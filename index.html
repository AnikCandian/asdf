  <div id="content">
    <p>Many have debated over the issue of whether Linux or Windows is superior. I believe Linux is in the right. Lemme explain.</p>
    <p>Linux is better because it uses UNIX like pretty much the rest of the world. Unless you download WSL, Windows has no compatability with it. Windows, go switch to a UNIX system if you want to compete.</p>
    <p>Remember to eat your vegetables.</p>

    <p>This blog entry is too short. >=-[</p>
    <p>Oh, and the end phrase isn't related to the topic. That sucks. Not much I could do, since this is my only entry.</p>
